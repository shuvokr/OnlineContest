For solving a problem first try it yourself. It will be great if you can solve it yourself :) . 
If you think that you need some hints for solving the problem try to discuss with someone or 
try to understand the solution from the code & then think yourself, what did you think for 
solving the problem. Also see the solution for the purpose of knowing multiple solutions 
for a problem.
