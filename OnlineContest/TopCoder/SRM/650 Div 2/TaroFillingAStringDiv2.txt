PROBLEM STATEMENT

Cat Taro likes strings.
You are given a string S.
Each character of S is 'A', 'B', or '?'.




To Taro, the ugliness of a string is the number of pairs of equal consecutive characters.
For example, the ugliness of "ABABAABBB" is 3: there is one pair "AA" and two (overlapping) pairs "BB".




Taro now wants to change each question mark in S either to 'A' or to 'B'.
His goal is to minimize the ugliness of the resulting string.
Return the smallest ugliness that can be achieved.
